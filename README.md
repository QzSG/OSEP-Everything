# OSEP-Everything
Everything from my OSEP study.

Not fully complete, still adding stuff as I go

I would advise going through the OSEP study material and learning how to do things the way they teach in the course. Then use some of these tools to learn how to do it faster. 

## [Active Directory](/Active%20Directory/)
Tools for AD enumeration and exploitations
### [Delegation](/Active%20Directory/Delegation/)
Unconstrained, Constrained, Resource Based Constrained.
### [LAPS](/Active%20Directory/LAPS/)
LAPS stuff

### [Relay](/Active%20Directory/Relay/)
Relay stuff

## [AMSI](/AMSI/)
Contiains my AMSI bypass

## [Anti-Virus](/Anti-Virus/)
Tools for AV

##  [CLM bypass](/CLM%20bypass/)
Sliver and Meterpreter have built in bypassess. Including one more for when defender is still on. And then a backup.

## [CSharp Everything](/Csharp%20Everything/)
Collections of CSharp stuff

## [EveryBox](/EveryBox/)
These are things I run on every box. 

## [MSSQL](/MSSQL/)
MSSQL stuff

## [Phishing](/Phishing/)
[HTA](/Phishing/HTA/) and [Word](/Phishing/Word/) for phishing purposes.

### [HTA](/Phishing/HTA/)
