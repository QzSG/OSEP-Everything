# Everybox
Stuff I ran on every box

## dropav.ps1
My own version of https://github.com/emanuelepicas/OSEP/blob/master/AV-Evasion/DisableSecuritySettings/dropAV_AND_More.ps1
Rolls back AV definitions, disable AV functions, disables the firewall, allows RDP and PTH for RDP. 

### Host with gup
https://github.com/beauknowstech/gup
Or `python3 -m http.server` but I like gup better. Obviously. I made it to be better.
